deformation and river response before specific examples of tectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed a brief review of types of tectonic activity types of rivers and river response will be presented this background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow types of deformation the superficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms fs illustrated in figure 21 the displacement can be seismic and associated kith earthquakes and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor faults may ba lateral faults that displace or offset the channel figure a without vertical displacement this type of displacement should be easily recognizee faults with vertical displacement may have butte uplift block upstream of the fame with the result that gradient is steepened figure ba in the opposite case the gradient will be decreased figure ac the effect will resemble monoclinic tilting figure fa ag irs of baud may produce uplifted horst or dropped blocks graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient figure ad be this has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and geosynclines figure ah i in addition to all of these structural features the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain figure dj ak al the possibilities are great but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or valley tilting streams respond to vertical displacement along faults figure ba and ac by aggradation or degradation when the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient figure ba erosion will be initiated in this reach when the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream figure ac aggradation will occur even all displacements may be sufficient bo induce aggradation or degradation bo large streams if the displacement forms a dam figure ac the stream will be blocked and it will flow along the fault or form a lake wallah 1968 mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream biyear of a fault can produce a dam across a all stream which can divert its course cruller figure 21 surface deformation by faulting folding and lateral tilting hedland view on left dissection on right from couching 1983 small arrows indicate direction of willpower large arrows indicate direction of movement the displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated horst and graben figure ad and jet comeback two different types doe vertical displacement figure ba and ac there will be aggradation upstream from the horst and degradation which will migrate upstream on the downstream part of the horst reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation upstream tipoff the graben there will be degradation manque aggradation in the nigrae itself a river in such a location will be unstable as artier pand alt 1982 suggested for the bitter river in montana the type of folding figure 21 will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting but changes will probably be less abrupt the effects of tilting will depend upon the amount but in the simplest case steepening of a valley will cause degradation figure ak and a reverse tilt figure al will cause deposition lateral tilting will cause channel shift downfall figure dj or avulsion figure ac shows only simple but exaggerated cases whereas actual displacements can be more complicated for example faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed for example small stream channels have been offset by strikes movement figures 18 a of the san andre fault wallah 1968 pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes the main reason why channel offset caused by the san andre fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault 203 year brown and wallah 1968 and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault while fault displacements are obvious movements fa the land surface by folding can be slow however this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behaving for example concentration of erosion alogia only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt jefferson 1907 manson a bleeder and alexander ar types of alluvial rivers it is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently nekton deformation therefore their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can abwab valuated this can sestet be done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern five basic channel patterns exist figure 22 1 straight channels with either migrating sand waves or 2 with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg 3 two types of meandering channels a highly sinuous channel of equal width patten boa and channels that are wide at bends than in crossings pattern ba 4 the meandering transition and 5 a typical braided stream the relative stabile of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels as related to relative sediment size celom velocity of flow and stream power are also indicated in figure 22 it has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying aschheim gradient sediment load stream power and the type of sediment load transported by the channel chummy and kahn 1972 therefore alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of diminish load moving through the channels as suspended mixed and load channels figure 22 water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel width depth meander dimensions but the relative proportions of bed load sand and gravel and suspended load silts and clays determine not only the shape of the channel but depth ratio and channel pattern a suspended channel has been defined as one that transports less than 3 percent bed load and a load channel as one transporting more than 11 percent bed load chummy 1977 the mixed channel lies between these two figure ay null figure ac channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated chummy 1981 alluvial rivers that transorbital clay silt sand and gravel can be placed within these three general categories however within the meandering group there is considerable range of jocosity 125 to 30 in addition in the braided category there are braided and braided channels islands are vegetated bars figure 22 suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum but experimental work nd field studies bushveld indicated that the changes of pattern between braided meandering and straight occur relatively abruptly at pattern thresholds figure 23 the bittern changes take place at critical values of stream power gradient and sediment load chummy and kahn 1972 null figure 23 relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant quaternary discharge sediment load stream power velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables from chummy and khan 1972 although the five patterns of figure 22 involve paella three river types there are five basic load channel patterns figure a that have been recognizee during experimental studies of channel patterns chummy 1977 ap 158 these five basic bedlam channel patterns can be extended to nixed and suspended channels to produce 13 river patterns figure 24 patterns 15 are load channel patterns patterns 610 are mixed channel patterns and patterns 1113 are suspended channel patterns figure 24 attempts to shoal sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change growth increasing valley slope stream power and sediment load for acne channel type the three major river types are controlled by type of sedilia load but within each type the different patterns reflect increased valley slope sediment load and stream power the different load channel patterns figure bo can be described as follows pattern 1 straight essentially equal channel with migrating sand waves pattern 2 alternate channel with migrating side bo alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg pattern 3 sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes pattern 4 transitional meandering aided channel the large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes but a meandering thalweg can be identified pattern 5 sixsided a typical braided channel as compared to the load channels the five mixed channels figure ba are relatively narrower and deeper and there is greater banjo stability the higher degree of turnkey stability permits the maintenance of narrow steep straight channels pattern 6 and alternate bars stability because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels pattern 7 pattern 8 is a truly meandering channel wide on the bends relatively narrow at the crossings and subject bo chute cutoffs pattern 9 maintains eighthes sinuosity of a meandering channel but with a greater sediment transport the presence toque bars gives it a composite braided appearance pattern 10 is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of load channel 5 and it is likely to abwab braided null figure 24 the range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types a load channel patterns ba mixed channel patten ac suspended channel patterns from chummy 1981 suspended channels figure ac are narrow and deeper than mixed channels suspended loam pattern 11 is a straight narrow deep channel with only small quantities of bed load this type fa channel may have the highest sinuosity of all patterns 12 and 3 rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely that is a suspended channel pattern 12 could become braided pattern 5 oar a braided channel pattern 5 could become meandering pattern 8 or 12 etc when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel therefore the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics there is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of figure 24 this is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments chummy et al 1996 the channel segments can be straight meandering or braided and they appear to span he range of channel types anastomose or anabranch channels differ from aided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain aigret 25 whereas braided channels have multiple thalweg in a single channel knight and manson 1993 and richards et al 1993 suggest that antis pattern is transitioned to a single channel recuse anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys smith and smith 1980 and tectonic uplift gregory and chummy 1987 reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important and therefore anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity evidence of deformation the first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landform that result from continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces these obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers drainage networks the arrangement of streams bond tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops climate and the corrodibility of the surface material local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern figure 12 for example experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 25 percent whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes phillips and chummy 1987 knurl figure 25 map of anastomosing channels of ovens and king rivers number indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest 1 to oldest 4 from chummy et al 1996 local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns a topographic high caused by active uplift will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern for instance on the slope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope this can cause portions of the drainage patted to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network an uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope figure 26 as the major streams are deflected away from the uplift tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened changes of an entire drainage network as na result of tilting are described by sparling 1967 who notes that isostatic adjustment in ottawa county ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decree the gradient of others incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient russell 1939 described various drainage paterna found pian the flat eluvial lands of louisiana and he recognizee a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern as a presley of tilting and steepening of the gradient null figure 26 drainage pattern modified by uplift price and whetstone 1977 used volumetric river and valley dissection profiles as evidence for movement along the chattanooga embayment in florida subsidence caused southward migration of eastward flowing channels flowing streams exhibit paired terraces while eastward trending revamp contain extensive terraces on the northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin subsidence in the chattanooga payment and adjacent warping along the chattanooga uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the chattanooga river continued tilting in a valley infarction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network bergere 1979 noted this type of asymmetry in an area near tao new mexico figure 27 using minute us geological survey topographic 2 maps he described this asymmetry quantitatively by selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to baths contour in a downtime direction add and in the opposite uptilt direction du an index of asymmetry was developed adduce figure 27 the index for 30 small drainage basins was 06 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a downtime direction coxa 1994 used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern mississippi embayment other indices of asymmetry are described by rathskeller and inter 1996 pp 126 127 null figure 27 map of asymmetrical stream valleys in the vicinity of tao new mexico showing method of measuring distances used in calculating index of asymmetry modified after bergere 1979 lake patterns lakes are temporary cures in terms of geological time but they can be clear evidence of deformation they occur at various scales along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time they may be isolated but the are more frequently clustered in a specific area or they are aligned along specific trends isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses which form a dam but clustered lakes are due to regional processes which may be related to climate koran macroclimate geotectonic deformation or frequently a combination of these processes large lake may occupy geological basins and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations the bolivian convertiplane kulaks otitic popover unit stand at an elevation of around 4000 am and are associated with plate convergence and uplift continental stretching and tensional tectonics are adorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics see chapter 5 where foot lake and the mississippi valley docklands are described figures 51 52 null figure 28 inferred

continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earths surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers for example lake victoria is

applied at lakes that are long and narrow these lakes are superimposed over basement structures in subsiding basins they are also closely related to active tectonics the nahuatl 1324 km and tunga kw

the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of andean tectonics beaumont and garcia 1991 more precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the tunga lake according to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals tiglic 1904 the area was covered by forest that developed on a terrace before 1923 then the region began to subside the tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible now below 2 am of water during low water ages in this very flat area the water level rises about 2 am during floods suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 am over about 70 years a tectonic interpretation is bored because a local rise of bas level cannot eke involved only a downward motion of esther area where the lake as observed can explain the phenomenon these lakes are related to dropped blocks that are related to a tensional system terraces the vertical warping of terraces as a result of automation has been studied by numerous investigators machina 1960 duchies 1980 king and stein 1983 the offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement the offset terraces at the mouth of the chine gorge in new zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement figure 212 in addition to river terraces the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces rathskeller and inter 1996 are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally xt a given water level an example is the isostatic deformation of the pleistocene lake eviller shorelines hut critter 1963 portions of the lake eviller shorelines have been deformed as much ks 210 feet as it drained and evaporated to form great salt knobkerrie in addition deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the pacific coast of ajar california forme 1980 not only are terraces deformed but as an uplift

pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes structural geologists and petroleum geologists have hypnoanalyses for years tat rivers are strong indicators of faulting blatta 1959 coward 1967 tectonic activity can significantly control river apatite and behaving and this is especially true of alluvial rivers beef 1966 and radula 1962 state that geotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope such as meander characteristics gnu addition the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley clearly one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream bender et al 1967 duchies 1979 alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change in order to maintain a instant gradient a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid whereas a reduction of valley slope ill lead sitcom a reduction nf sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change for example widal 1966 reported that booth the flinders and richard rivers have changed to a braided pattern as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the self upward in northern queensland australia and the red river near winnipeg canada fijis straightening as as result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound welch 1973 other examples are provided by the mississippi river between st louis and cairo and the lower missouri river adams 1980 as well as the red river of the north near winnipeg canada panick and nag 1980 baseless changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics and can provide information on channel change for example if sealevel is lowered and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift lane 1955 argued that a lowering of baseless will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river indeed lanes 1955 argument that a stream wild restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baseless change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished however sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation another fallacy in lanes argument is the assumption that the valley kilohertz and channel gradient are identical this is cot the case and the dimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions for example a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor sinuosity ap is betjeman ratio between panne length al ac aid valley length al cv and it is also the ratio between valley spec as cv and channel gradient as ac as follows therefore a straight channel has a sinuosity of 10 and the gradient of the channel and the slope of bushveld valley floor are the same it has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes chummy 1968 and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the mississippi indus and nile reflect the variability of the valley slope chummy et al 1994 largens et al 1993 chummy and gala 1994 null figure 213 effect of a baseless fall on channel length and pattern see text for discussion figure 213 illustrates this concept geometrically and it shows the impact of the lowering bog baseless in a valley with a stream of sinuosity ap 15 the line ac represents the channel profile and the line abc represents the profile of the valley floor points ba and ac are at the river mouth and points fa and ag are at the same location an the valley the channel distance is nonethical longer than the valley distance and the differ in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream the length of the channel is 15 times the length of the valley and therefore the stream gradient is nonethical less than the valley slope equation 1 if a vertical fall of baseless from ba to ad and ac to be is assumed channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor if the channel is not confined laterally it can adjust to the increased valley slope fd by increasing sinuosity to 20 and the channel profile is blended to ah in this case incision ceases at point fa in the valley nd at point ag in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 15 to 0 from ag to ah maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope fd the nonethical increase of channel length sinuosity between ag and ah compensate for a nonethical steepening of the valley floor from fa to ad according to lanes assumptions the effect bo this baseless fall would be propagated upstream to point a where an amount of erosion equal to bd would occur however because the stream can adjust the steepening bo the valley floor will not result in na change of carbamic gradin rather the channel lengthens and the effect conf baseless lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream the distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor but this exercise supports saucier 1991 contention that pleistocene sea level change in the lower mississippi valley was effective only as far as baton rouge see also blumba 1993 and blumba and alas 1994 the probability that da large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baseless changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly unlike during the experimental studies the river therefore has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity further evidence for the type of channel response shown in figure 213 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of jefferson ware 1992 oral comm he lowered baseless relatively slowly to a maximum of 12 cm in a flume with a total length of 184 be this change would have doubled the channel gradient however the effect of the baseless lowering extended only 4 am upstream and the change in baseless was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from 12 to 15 in esther lower 4 am in the flume it is clear however that bittern change did not totally compensate for the change of baseless this channel widened and roughness increased thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baseless change wares experiments showed that a sinuosity increase which resulted in a slop decrease was only part of the adjustment and width depth and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power therefore channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baseless change the river nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing apse valley slope changes chummy and gala 1994 changes of valley gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations but variate of valley slope can be the result of several influences tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel afternoon adams 1980 in addition a transporting tributary may build a manlike deposit in the valley which will persist even after the salutary sediment load has decreased when the main river crosses this fan pattern changes will result as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient tributaries to the jordan river i israel have developed manlike deposits in the already and the valley floor of the jordan valley exculpates as a trisulphide the jordan river as it approaches one joyful these convexities straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course ikon the steeper downstream side of the fan chummy 1977 ap 140 it is important to etherealizes hat channels that lie near a pattern threshold figure 23 may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable for example some rivers that are meandering and that are near patted thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load chummy 199 experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valley slope will cause a change of channel morphology the change will offer however depending where the channel dies on a plot such as hat of figure 23 and pending on withheld type of channel figure 24 for example with increasing slope cv straight cannel will become sinuous a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous and a meandering channel will braid with decreasing slope a braided channel ii meander and a meandering channel will straighten null figure 214 reaches aft degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting although pattern changes may dominate river response deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient figure 214 in fact upstream deposition wild reduce downstream sediment loads thereby rasing the tendency for downstream erosion therefore in addition to the primary valley deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation there are order effects beyond the area of deformation for example deposition upstream noma the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation figure 214 this means that the uplift is acting as a dam and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation however it big more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion an the steeper downstream reach and when this increased load moves downstream aggradation will result figure 214 null figure 215 effect of change from weaker kw to more resistant ar materials on meander pattern another aspect of both active and geotectonic is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades resistant alluvium clay plugs gravel armorial or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shit and bank erosion the result should be deformed or compressed meander upstream and a change of meander character at the contact for example as meanders shift valley their movement may be retarded miff more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered jink and chummy 1987 hence a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed figure 215 a similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upward or ashford as a result of incision it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course xeromenia and divan 1977 reviewed postdevelopmental russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts the largest number of meanders procure upstream of the structures which supports haggardness 1975 observations if bedrock channels in the colorado plateau this is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of figure 23 therefore an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone discussion alluvium is usually assumed to hid the underlying geology but rates of active tectonic movement are anciently rapid to gaffe the morphology an bechamel of alluvial rivers rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even slow aseismic tectonic activity for example evidence of active tectonics is as follows 1 deformation of valley flor longitudinal profile 2 deformation of channel longitudinal profile 3 change of channel pattern 4 change of channel width and depth 5 conversion of floodplain to a low terrace at reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift 7 effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation degradation aggradation flooding bank erosion 8 formation of lakes alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics therefore it ma be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when in fact human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time pattern change alone ails not sufficient evidence for active tectonics rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence pandor surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation in many areas the evidence will be circumstantial nevertheless anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls tributary influences lithologic change bo geotectonic may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise lakes can also provide information muon subsidence and aria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences for example during pleistocene aggradation in the ohio river and mississippi river valleys numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys therefore care must knobkerrie exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies
