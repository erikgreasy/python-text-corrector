submitted by light refractions if you are a fan of fashioned what is now known as traditional or trad jazzy are familiar with one of tx standard jump tunes of the genre tune most commonly called muskrat ramble even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times it is the one that goes ah ah ah ah dadda deadheaded deadheaded thats it sure you've heard it i think i first bought a recording of muskrat ramble back in about a when i was in my early teens my memory is rickety but i am sure my first recording was label muskrat ramble and i think though i am less sure that it was played by the late muggy spaniel who was to my mind be of the greatest a jazz trumpeters later i got another recording of the same tune this one by i think me meow the label said muscat ramble i thought that was surely the first tame i had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple pm record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors ere calmed typographical errors not typos least by kids in junior hah some time later i got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat amble that i thought was really absurd nt only ad they left out the a they changed the a to a now it made no sensa at all on the her hand i reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it want so outrageous i looked up muscat in my webster and found that it is a variety of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous a was young and by days standards aa last pathetically innocent during ah time in senior high and after that a the army air force i had other things a my mind there was a car on after all and i dint give the muskrats ramble poem any thought speaking of my time in the aa which was utterly undistinguished i think i must make a confession now might be as clod a time as any to reveal a theft i committed at an air force base near seyor indiana it was winter and bitterly cold the wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with thai seemed an absolute determination to crystalline your boxes nc day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero i took shelter in the slice club there was the omnipresent phonograph or ic short for viola and the stack of records next to it in those days people ac a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded nard in sacs where they picked up dust scratched one another and traded static electricity i was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and i came across three bess smiths i played all three and the few other gi in the room which was quite largening enough for a fairies dance with a small orchestrate paid no attention or asked me to put on something by glen miller a jimmy or tommy horsey instead among basses numbers were dying gamblers blues sing sing prison blues and one i had never heard called black mountain blues which has the incomparable lines me in black mountain a chile will smack yo face me in black mountain a chile will smack yo face babies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass and gin back to black mountain ie an my razor an my gun gin back to black mountain me an my razor an my gun bin cut him if he stan sell gin shoot him if he run i was and still am captivated by babies cry for liquor an he birds sing bass and in the arrogance of my youth i was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who bess smith was nor would any her gi be enchanted by basso bird so i turned thief i cant remember how i did it but somehow i smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough i kept them in good shape until my last pm turntable died end of digression and back to muskrat muskrat ramble is credited to edward kid or an ray gilbert kid or played great jazz trombone the only thing i know about gilbert is that i fib him listed as coauthor of muskrat ramble about thirty years ago when i was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that i had no sherry on hand i went to he liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that i thought might be exactly right for my sauce it want bad the wine jogged my thoughts back to muscat ramble muscatel is made fm muscat grapes i sometimes called muscat and being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many wines an old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday twenty years of aa sobriety couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding be rails from dunk bank to drunk tank the fluorite terms for scat were caboodle and nap valley smoke i made up my mind bat muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that kid lory or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even es like that they a anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according a my encyclopedia low like giant rats are found in and around the banks bordering marshes nd quiet ponds wa partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming they do not appear to do much cabling muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on sod rows all over the land a guy with a outleaped bren paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds ar pretty good you would find it is a caboodle after the gp finishes his nap valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix now hz is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in at dogmapped eyes i suspect that that is precisely the songs origin my theory is that the a got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat it ps the same reason most of us i assume have heard es in the hospital with prostrate trouble prostrate is a more common word that prostate so prostrate us what we get the a fits in naturally i got a strange sort ff corroboration from my good friend os charge who is ow pushing eighteen years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best bandsmen goodman red nicholas ted deems and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat muscat and muscat i asked him what he thought the original tit was he had known kid or well and he said you know tom i not exactly sure i nc asked or about it and he said its muscat muskrat so i stink thats just the way everyone said muscat a there you are i find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually i picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water bib a wouldst call that rambling on the other nd a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level that has

explorer ernest gilet put it the explorers experience is a baptism worse than that if firth baptism of no mater my impression was that in the journals co desert explorers the word water alone or in compounds and words relating to water were unusually frequent it is i suppose likely that people with little money must think of money more than the falloff do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and he thirsty on drink here was a chance to quantify such things i decided to mae a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration taking quite at random a single page page a in the journals of the gregory brothers recording an early a exploration of county east and north of perth i find the word water used fifteen times ten pages on page a water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream twice well twice pool channel and the circumlocution essential element two words dew and shower refer in the context to the presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its absence i triad anomer explorer ernest files takin page a again i was reminded that files is rather given to semiserious poetic diction at times and we find hi referring

addition here was a rich collection of words relating to water not necessarily indicating its presence hoping to find a lake ifs included though of course it doest indicate the presence of water even words which are usually of bore general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like tars gumtrees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of possible water apart from these words

alive i britain nd the greenhead common women are probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the cruise missiles installed at an american base beer that village in britain as elsewhere most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women usually feminists men are seldom assigned to review them possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if not biased against them or because the editor is a woman because writing an unfathomable review of a baa feminist book would be tantamount to treachery such books are often unjustifiably praised as was eh case wish this work by rosalind miles which was well received on its publication a june according to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book rosalind miles is head of the entre for wens studies at coventry polytechnic a lecturer broadcaster journalist and author of several other books including a highly acclaimed biography of ben jonson ole might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship be the text does not bear out the promise for the most part the book consists of a rewriting of history from the dawn of time with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes the fact that women were responsible for all the important contributions a the advancement of ciliation as the development of agriculture for instance often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men and the fact that women have long been subjected to domination by ben miles suggest that such domination is a recent phenomenology a couple of thousand years older she points to the clear superiority a women in primitive religions and matriarchies right a through ro the egyptian dynastic rulers at one point she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting in order to keep track of menstruation and probably by the same token astronomy she quotes and presumably accepts another source which holds that woman first wakened in humankind the capacity a recognizee abstracts if you believe that balderdash you'll believe anything in the good old days we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves rect speculation has it that they were not slaves butt

tabour built the pyramids bound jan fetters they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day they have not a rag to cower their nakedness and neither the weakness of age nor omens

what him authority might have been fr such a vivid description it is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept bit and have the effrontery to promulgate it miles book i riddled with many similar distortions convenient omissions and generations women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity from the poet sappho who in the sixth

too bad early on when according to miles the seven jacobean martyrs who saved judas did so only at the instigation of their mother miles continues in early christianity likewise doyen found not merely a role but an instrument of resistance to male nomination kin choosing to be a brave of christ they inevitably cocked ma snook at lesser male fry thousands of young women helped to build the hunch of

philippic ibid this rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of forgetter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring and so forth to women citing a judaic lawbook of the hah century which identified a woman for the days preceding during and following her period as nidal impure miles has the lack of taste to write the following as a dial stroke in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held ai store for the jews ah nidal had to wear special clothing as a badge a her separate and despised status pa here and there in is morass of misunderstanding miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with the eminent anthropologist joseph campbell campbell known for his extensive analysis of the worlds mythologies religions nd cultures noted the marked bias against women emerging from judaic concepts later reinforced by christian and islamic doctrine most of the religions of the world connected woman with mother earth fertility and all the other orogenetic and nurturing associations and this was borne out in the cultures of the people according to campbell ah only godlike female figure in the bible is the virgin mary and se appears identified as virgil only in the gospel according to luke as luke was a greek campbell suggested that mr was a carryover from the paganism of the ancient greek pantheon although this might help explain the

whether campbell was commenting an hinduism buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures

is a ocular pursuit and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums not so paralinguistics or the reconstruction of ancient languages even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse classical latin and greek hebrew and a few other languages are better documented than others but for most all we gyve to ga on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions chert barely enough a many cases to allow us to identify the language let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning perhaps one day we shall find an etruscan library buried deep in the italian countryside but for the preset we have to make do with fat we have which is precious little about languages that had bo writing system we know nothing at all but some very clever comparative linguists beginning in germany in the auth century thrived about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues in some instances ancient languages have been decoded some from multilingual inscriptions the work of jean francis champion a in deciphering hieroglyphics from the rosette stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge ce have today about their ciliation wych lasted for about a years another significant breakthrough was that of michael veneris a who deciphered the linear a script on on crete and identified it as an early form of greek fm the standpoint of language entries work was more important particularly because it filled in a gap in au knowledge a the early states of european languages many years ago a linguistic scholar counted al of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence the total was approximately a but that is probably only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed some some have sprung up since hp time modern hebrew for instance and some have vanished the exact count ms unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language then too one must examine the techniques used to gop the many languages of the world linguists examining classical greek latin german english slavic swedish norwegian danish dutch lithuanian iranian hindi and the other languages of india and europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words some like french spanish italian and portuguese had more in common with one another tan they did with say german english swedish danish and dutch which in turn bore only a remote resemblance do russian and polish on the one hand and the two extant varieties of say gaelic on the other one rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes for after years ff laborious catering these languages the number of different main branches called families and subfamilies came to about ten ingeniously bertin differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that inexpiably took place in one language group but not in another although certain other languages were geographically nearby it was impossible to establish any resemblances between hem hence basque for example is not classified as being in the same family with other european languages nor are hungarian and finnish both of which belong to heir own group at the conclusion of this vast exercise done without the ai of computers there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken in earlier times from britain as far east as chinese turkoman and from india as far north as lapland charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionaries the front cover of the rand house unabridged for example because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among langues it is best to avoid using an older chart for the same reason it would be wise not to take too much un the accuracy of even a current chart the languages discussed here are what are sally called the european family similar family trees could be drawn for the semitic languages tibetan japanese bantu polynesian and so on each is a distinct phylum although there ay be borrowing among oem lexicon is considered less important in the classification a language than structure and grammar it is important too to note that writing systems are irrelevant for instance polish is written today using the roman alphabet but russian a related slavic language uses the cyrillic yiddish a germanic language is written in hebrew characters latin greek and sanskrit which resemble ode another rather closely in some respects all use different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizably to untrained readers of modern languages were written in cuneiform quite suitable for writing an soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics it would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organide languages tue were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials a only rarely did they collaborate an with few exceptions their work was not correlated in a systematic way scaleman who discovered the site of troy used the evidence in homers iliad to determine his digging site where any ruins had long since disappeared from view in many other places the ancient sites lay buried still beneath modern cities modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that tin remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below today before a new building is erected in london an archaeological team examines the cleared site fr its archaeological significance bet there as everywhere else nothing can interfere with progress and regardless of the finds and their prance the archaeologist must eventually

based on ah sparse evidence available linguists theories about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested in other words based on what they kw about a group of languages which were documented they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from in mast cases they dealt with words and functional elements eating what are caged reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called variously prolamin protegee erotogenic indianian and so forth the ultimata goal being to posit a single language called motoneuron that is not entirely true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was literally a single language from which all european languages descended nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of dialects which can be referred to as motoneuron in seems only natural that once an original language or space was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or heat that is what renew has tried to do essentially he proposes that the parent of all european languages was itself born in central anatolia whence it spread eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact till it ultimately emerged in its recognizably modern manifestations which we categoric into germanic hellenic ital indianian anatolian armenian celtic topiarian albanian and balsamic i eve no quarrel with renews notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of ate blab sea legion and the volga steppes it is difficult for the nonspecialist reader like me to assess the validity of his arguments which care based a his contention that the language and its congeners were carried along by he spread of nomad pastoralism using the evidence available renew contends that the original european language closely related to hittite separated after a a with ah a languages ff western europe developing from stern anatolia and those of iran india and pakistan from the eastern division the choice between the prevailing theory and renews depends on whether one accepts a wave theory first promulgated me than a hundred years ago by jonahes schmidt a german linguist or one of indigenous development pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture fm armenia or a late development of the indus ciliation renew accepts the wave theory and an the last two thirds of archaeology language he sets forth his arguments in st pavor unfortunately the presentation of his linguistic argument where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology where he i on more familiar territory is distrained and repetitious it is difficult to place all the blame on renew for his editor should ba noticed the lack of coherence the result is an argument that is persuasive but snarely convincing nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilable by

look it up as everyone in the world must know by now william afire writes ma column in the new york times magazine called on language considering the circulation of the new york times on sundays his column is probably the most widely red commentary on contemporary english in de world that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer he must do his utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjects likely to a of interest to his readers and he must write well those familiar with satires editorial style reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of the a a times may agree with me in the contention cat when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off i cannot put a finger an why but on language always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute in part that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents ho keep him informed on language that is not within earshot as the lexicographic irregulars an amusing reference ha first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy more often than it might prove of interest to me personally afire deals with insiders language in washington where he is abed or with trivialities uttered by some politico as andrew norman wrote in sa letter published in this book on pa a you flit freely back and forth between prescriptivism and descriptivism but are not may of us guilty of that we are descriptive ff the usage we accept and prescriptiveness proscriptive would be more descriptive thus we do not like at least afire expresses ban opinion whether tt reader agrees with him is another matter as are the questions of his accuracy which arise fairly often and that of the suitability of his style which as far as i know has not been broached before it ill behooves me excoriated recently

deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which i must pick my way to the end notwithstanding the valuable role he play in inspiring linguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject i find it hard slogging or as he would probably write slogging you could look it up is the umpteenth collection of satires columns and like the previous collections contains a selection of letters rom readers it is those that are so sorely missed in his column true there as an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a correspondent and the letters section of the magazine prints a comment from time bo time but an important feature of the books is their inclusion of far mo treader interaction than one might suspect from reading the column alone for ore thing the letterers call attention to errors or misinterpretations and are largely critical afire cannon be accuse of being copepod except evidently ff awful puns as in a ms is deliberately mysterious but at least at is not deliberately misleading a and other miscegenations here is no gainsaying that afire is one of the most influential writers an contemporary english and it is essential that his books be is the libraries of all who are interested in the subject regardless of their alignment with his opinions for one thing he documents many neologisms an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers from the sometimes cavalier manner in which he treats his subject one wonders if afire feels the burden of the responsibility he has toward his

based at the university of lees conducted the survey of english dialects which studied a localities in england which as everyone ought a know does not include wales or scotland the present book il extracted from the two major works that resulted from the survey the linguistic ails of england a and a word geography of england a both under the direction of harold orion aided by anderson and

of the ordinary i have only one nit to pick with the authors in their description oaf isogloss the write these are drawn to run midway between localities which were shown by the survey of english dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of he map although it is true that isogloss in effect set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded more

word to describe true lief on a map where the terms are of equal distribution isogloss are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps what isobaths are a geophysical maps of the oceans etc the authors are not alone in getting is wrong it is incorrect in some dictionaries in those countries where dialect study is undertaken dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries the incardination of terminology as adopted by national periodicals news services radio and television the establishment of prestige dialects and through the media their promulgation and the huge population shifts that have taken place particularly in the us ice ii such shifts have been somewhat slower in england but seem now to be speeding up there are may other lesser factors at work but taken together all tend toward incardination especially as tie older speakers die off in some respects it may not be long
