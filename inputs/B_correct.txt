Red Pants While writers whose business it is to be witty often fail to produce grave authors occasionally are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their minds From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind I have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate Red Pants items a sampling of which follows My designation derives from a splash of vivid writing in Francis Thompsons A Corymbus for Autumn in which he proclaims how ‚údays dying dragon‚ù was Panting red pants into the West In this trousers category Thompson must share the limelight with Coleridge by virtue of the line in Kubla Khan As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing Even Shelley may stake a claim if only in the pajama division of this sector thanks to his description in Epipsychidion of how the slow silent night Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare it is not surprising that on at least two occasions the Board has contributed his own Red Pants nuggets In Antony and Cleopatra Act IV Scene VIII lines 14 et seq Antony commands the wounded Scarus to leap thou attire and all Through proof of harness to my heart and there Ride on the pants triumphing And in Othello Act II Scene I line 80 Cassio utters the fervent prayer that Othello might Make loves quick pants in Desdemonas arms A variation on this theme occurs in Alba de C√spedes The Secret translated from the Italian by Isabel Quigly Simon and Schuster New York 1958 page 114 where she confides that ‚úI still had a whole afternoon before me to spend and I used it to tidy up my drawers‚ù One may well wonder what Miss Stowe had in mind when in Uncle Toms Cabin Chapter 5 she narrates how ‚úMrs Shelby stood like one stricken Finally turning to her toilet she rested her face in her hands and gave a sort of groan‚ù In this same vein the mirthless Milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of nations when in describing Mount Etna in Book I of Paradise Lost lines 2367 he penned And leave a singed bottom all involved With stench and smoke And in Chapter VI of Vanity Fair when Blenkinsop the housekeeper sought to console Amelia for Joe Sedleys jilting of her dear Rebecca Thackeray confides indelicately that Amelia wept confidentially on the housekeepers shoulder ‚úand relieved herself a good deal‚ù Chuckles often emanate from the British employment of a term in a sense at variance with American usage There is that oftquoted example near the opening of Trial by Jury where Defendant asks ‚úIs this the Court of the Exchequer‚ù and having been assured that it was Defendant aside commands himself to ‚úBe firm be firm my pecker‚ù The British of course do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue since to them pecker means courage as in the phrase ‚úto keep your pecker up‚ù Two of the more common examples of BritishAmerican divergence of usage are screw and knock up In Vanity Fair Chapter 39 the niggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat your American sophomore might fancy him to be when he ‚úscrewed his tenants by letter‚ù He was simply making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees Similarly when in Chapter XXXIV of the same novel Mrs Bute reminds her husband that ‚úYoud have been screwed in goal Bute if I had not kept your money‚ù she was not speaking of pleasures deferred In Bleak House Chapter XXVII Grandfather Smallweed referring to Mr George warns Mr Tulkinghorn that ‚úI have him periodically in a vice Ill twist him sir Ill screw him sir‚ù In Kiplings The Light That Failed Chapter XIII Torpenhow urges Dick to attend a party that night ‚úWe shall be half screwed before the morning‚ù is his dismal sales pitch to Dick In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair Thackeray reports on Joe Sedleys drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the next morning even if he had to ‚úknock up the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth‚ù in order to have him in readiness to perform the ceremony In Great Expectations Chapter VI we learn how ‚ú Mr Whopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper‚ù And who could blame him Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from the pureminded use of a word that suggests unmentionable parts of the human body It does not take a toowicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a lewd nature Who can for instance blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he reads in Paters Marius The Epicurean Chapter V a reference to Apuleius The Golden Ass noting that ‚úall through the book there is an unmistakably real feeling for asses ‚ù In Scotts The Bride of Lammermoor Chapter VII one reads about a boy ‚úcudgelling an ass‚ù and one goes back over the passage to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical error for ‚úcuddling‚ù One may be indulged a giggle even though he is sure that Isak Dinesen did not intend an impropriety when she recorded in Out of Africa Part V Chapter 4 how ‚úFathimas big white cock came strutting up before me‚ù And one is certain that Kenneth Rexroth in his American Poetry in the Twentieth Century Herder and Herder NY 1971 did not intend to hint at closet biographical matter when in Chapter I he wrote that ‚úWhitmans poems are full of men doing things together‚ù or later in the same chapter when he referred to ‚úWhitmans joyous workmen swinging their tools in the open air‚ù College freshman still read with flendish glee the first line in Canto I of Spensers The Faerie Queene and never mind the title that tells how A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine In his poem Mr Nixon from Hugh Selwyn Mauberley Ezra Pounds Mr Nixon advises kindly Dont kick against the pricks although the identities of the latter are not divulged One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous proposal the narrator had made in Prousts Remembrance of Things Past Vol 2‚Cities of the Plain translated by C K Scott Moncrieff‚Modern Library NY 1934 Page 90 to cause the Duchess to say ‚úApart from your balls cant I be of any use to you‚ù There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to his friend Edward Marsh from somewhere near Fiji p 463 of A Treasury of the Worlds Great Letters Simon and Schuster NY 1940 in which he relates how he sends his native boy up a palm tree where he ‚úcuts off a couple of vast nuts ‚ù macho victim not disclosed In the first chapter of Uncle Toms Cabin Miss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr Shelby part of which goes ‚ú Well said Haley after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season what do you say ‚ù In Bleak House Chapter XXIV Dickens may cause some readers to blush when he wrote of Mr Georges blush that ‚úHe reddened a little through his brown‚ù We must move ineluctably to a consideration of perfectly reputable words which having acquired sexual connotations cause adolescent‚and often adult‚ hilarity even when read by a person of only mildly prurient mind In Forsters A Passage to India Chapter XXXI a vivid picture is created by the sentence ‚úTangles like this still interrupted their intercourse‚ù Pages later Chapter XXXVII it is acknowledged that ‚úHe too felt that this was their last free intercourse‚ù Apparently from then on it was going to have to be cash or credit card only In The Bride of Lammermoor Chapter V we are informed that the heroine ‚úplaced certain restrictions on their intercourse‚ù a limitation that might have been more usefully set in that same authors Rob Roy Chapter VII where we are told of the chance that the narrator and Miss Vernon might be ‚úthrown into very close and frequent intercourse‚ù A variation of this theme is found in Robert Brownings The Flight of the Duchess Section V ‚Not he For in Paris they told the elf Our rough North land was the Land of Lays even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is n√∫mero uno in this area of human activity More picturesque are the references to erections An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India Chapter XXI in which Forster describes a small building as ‚úa flimsy and frivolous erection‚ù while in The Mayor of Casterbridge Chapter XVI the Mayor himself ‚úbeheld the unattractive exterior of Farfraes erection‚ù A phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader Consider Dickens sharp image in Bleak House Chapter LIV when he describes how ‚úSir Leicester leans back in his chair and breathlessly ejaculates ‚ù Or in Nicholas Nickleby Chapter XLVII where that admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur Gride ‚úagain raised his hands again chuckled and again ejaculated‚ù And in his short tale Lionizing Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction of one of his characters ‚ú Admirable he ejaculated thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre‚ù Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative meanings over the years Earlier in this century pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete male thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelleys noble image in Adonais verse XXXIII His head was bound with pansies overblown not to mention Poes odd allusion in For Annie With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies Or more slapstickish EF Bensons action picture in Lucia in London Chapter 8 ‚úGeorgie stepped on a beautiful pansy‚ù Of more recent vintage is gay Nobody used to snicker at Chaucers line No 5818 in The Prologe of the Wyf of Bathe in which that harried dame asks Why is my neghebores wif so gay In his poem The Menagerie one of William Vaughan Moodys characters advises If nature made you so graceful dont get gay while in Othello ah the Bard again in his dialogue with Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women Iago refers to the kind that Never lackd gold and yet went never gay Act II Scene I line 150 And what in the world is one to make of William Butler Yeatss startling revelation in his poem Lapis Lazuli from Last Poems that They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay Indeed it is an amusing albeit utterly wasteful pastime to pursue the quest for Red Pants examples May good cess befall all such quixotically misguided readers One caveat never assume blithely that an odd word or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds In The Bride of Lammermoor Chapter VI Bucklaw vows ‚úI will chop them off with my whinger‚ù and one feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is but a whinyard which is merely a short sword ‚úTurning a corner of the Mazza Gallerie into a womens tennis store I was startled to see hordes of giggling high school girls ‚ù From an article by Dorothy Gilliam in the Washington Post Submitted by LIGHT REFRACTIONS If you are a fan of oldfashioned jazz‚what is now known as ‚útraditional‚ù or ‚útrad‚ù jazz‚you are familiar with one of the standard ‚újump tunes‚ù of the genre‚a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble Even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times It is the one that goes ‚úDah Dah Dah Dah dadatdatdah Dadedadedadedatdatdah dadedadedadedatdatdah‚ù Thats it sure youve heard it I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble back in about 1940 when I was in my early teens My memory is rickety but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE and I think though I am less sure that it was played by the late ‚úMuggsy‚ù Spanier who was to my mind one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters Later I got another recording of the same tune this one by I think Mezz Mezzrow The label said MUSKAT RAMBLE I thought that was surely the first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple 78rpm record This remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors not typos‚at least by kids in junior high Some time later I got still another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE with still another version of the title This time it was MUSCAT RAMBLE That I thought was really absurd Not only had they left out the ‚úR‚ù theyd changed the ‚úK‚ù to ‚úC‚ù Now it made no sense at all On the other hand I reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasnt so outrageous I looked up muscat in my Websters and found that it is a variety of grape To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous I was young and by todays standards at least pathetically innocent During my time in senior high and after that in the Army Air Force I had other things on my mind there was a war on after all and I didnt give the MUSKRATMUSKATMUSCAT RAMBLE problem any thought Speaking of my time in the AAF which was utterly undistinguished I think I must make a confession Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour Indiana It was winter and bitterly cold The wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our bodies One day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero I took shelter in the service club There was the omnipresent phonograph or Vic short for Victrola and the stack of records next to it In those days people as a rule did not take much care of phonograph records Usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks where they picked up dust scratched one another and traded static electricity I was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and I came across three Bessie Smiths I played all three and the few other GIs in the room which was quite large‚big enough for a fairsized dance with a small orchestra‚either paid no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn Miller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead Among Bessies numbers were Dying Gamblers Blues Sing Sing Prison Blues and one I had never heard called Black Mountain Blues which has the imcomparable lines Home in Black Mountain a chile will smack yo face Home in Black Mountain a chile will smack yo face Babies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass and Goin back to Black Mountain me an my razor an my gun Goin back to Black Mountain me an my razor an my gun Goin cut him if he stan still goin shoot him if he run I was and still am captivated by ‚úBabies cry for liquor an the birds sing bass‚ù and in the arrogance of my youth I was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who Bessie Smith was nor would any other GI be enchanted by basso birds so I turned thief I cant remember how I did it but somehow I smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough I kept them in good shape until my last 78rpm turntable died End of digression and back to MUSKRATKATCAT Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward ‚úKid‚ù Ory and Ray Gilbert ‚úKid‚ù Ory played great jazz trombone The only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find him listed as coauthor of Muskrat Ramble About thirty years ago when I was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce It wasnt bad The wine jogged my thoughts back to Muscat Ramble Muscatel is made from muscat grapes is sometimes called muscat and being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many wines An old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday‚meaning twenty years of AA sobriety‚a couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk tank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and Napa Valley smoke I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune My reasoning is that it is not likely that ‚úKid‚ù Ory or Ray Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even less likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling Muskrats according to my encyclopedia look like giant rats are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds have partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming They do not appear to do much rambling Muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on skid rows all over the land A guy with a bottleshaped brown paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds are pretty good you would find it is a muscadoodle After the guy finishes his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix Now he is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his roadmapped eyes I suspect that that is precisely the songs origin My theory is that the ‚úr‚ù got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat It is the same reason most of us I assume have heard ‚úHes in the hospital with prostrate trouble‚ù Prostrate is a more common word that prostate so prostrate is what we get The ‚úr‚ù fits in naturally I got a strange sort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy McHargue who is now pushing eightyseven years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbands‚Benny Goodman Red Nichols Ted Weems and a slew of others Rosy too had seen the tune as Muskrat Muskat and Muscat I asked him what he thought the original title was He had known ‚úKid‚ù Ory well and he said ‚úYou know Tom Im not exactly sure I once asked Ory about it and he said Its muscat Muskrat So I think thats just the way everyone said muscat ‚ù There you are I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually I picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water but I wouldnt call that rambling On the other hand a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level‚now that has a touch of poetry Maybe not in the same class with ‚úall the birds sing bass‚ù but poetry nevertheless As a nonexpert although interested subscriber to VERBATIM it is ‚úa bit mysterious‚ù to me that the singular noun absence takes the plural verb are I refer to the first sentence of your article about the Longman Dictionary XV1 Helen W Power in ‚úWomen on Language Women in Language‚ù XV2 may bewail the insensitivity of the male But she betrays her own elitist insensitivity when she describes a flight attendant as ‚úthe person who passes peanuts on an airplane‚ù I hope MsMissMrs Power never needs to draw on the considerable firstaid and emergency training that every attendant must master Antipodean Newsletter Leonard Bloomfield having begun with a theory of meaning which emphasized the environment in which objects were present and named had to add the obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is not present I have lately been reading accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of Australia in the 1870s and I have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse In the desert the missing necessity is water As the explorer Ernest Giles put it the explorers experience is a ‚úbaptism worse than that of fire‚the baptism of no water‚ù My impression was that in the journals of desert explorers the word water alone or in compounds and words relating to water were unusually frequent It is I suppose likely that people with little money must think of money more than the welloff do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty on drink Here was a chance to quantify such things I decided to make a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration Taking quite at random a single page page 7 in the journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early 1846 exploration of country east and north of Perth I find the word water used fifteen times Ten pages on page 17 water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream twice well twice pool channel and the circumlocution ‚úessential element‚ù Two words dew and shower refer in the context to the presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its absence I tried another explorer Ernest Giles Taking page 17 again I was reminded that Giles is rather given to semiserious poetic diction at times and we find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke River as ‚úthe stream purling over its stony floor‚ù or quoting some bygone poet ‚úbrightly the brook through the green leaflets giddy with joyousness dances along‚ù Perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration Two hundred pages further on there is less exuberance in the circumlocution ‚úthat fluid so terribly scarce in the region‚ù and in three other references water is simply water Giles is not always waxing poetic and may like other explorers be useful as a source for the history of Australian and general English His use of the word tank to refer to a hollowedout reservoir ‚úGibson dug a small tank and the water soon cleared‚ù antedates the OED for instance Since this linguisticstatistical study of an obsession might well prove to be an important contribution to psycholinguistics I decided to make a larger sample of watery words choosing the straightforward journals of Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton who led an expedition across the western interior of Australia in 18734 In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages 15160 of the published journal there were twentyeight occurrences of the word water eight of them in compounds no page being without at least one example In addition there was a rich collection of words relating to water not necessarily indicating its presence ‚úHoping to find a lake‚ù is included though of course it doesnt indicate the presence of water Even words which are usually of more general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like this Gumtrees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of possible water Apart from these words and lake words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool springs drainage hole clay hole flood channel watercourses waterhole rockhole drink drinkable running water stream and native well The last two items merit comment Stream is often said not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical ways normally being replaced by creek Warburtons use ‚úsandbanks intercept the stream which finally splits into narow watercourses and spreads itself over the plains and so it ends as a creek‚ù suggests a somewhat more complex relation between the two words Britishborn explorers did not set out to write Australian English of course Gregory uses stream in the way normal in England Giles consistently refers to gens in the hills of central Australia though glen is not current outside placenames in contemporary Australian English The other name native well is as a later explorer David Carnegie author of Spinifex and Sand 1898 points out a misnomer He believes native wells are essentially rockholes depressions in rock buried in fairly shallow sand which when hollowed out by the natives appear to be wells This sort of misnomer leads Carnegie to suppose that ‚úto the uninitiated no map is so misleading as that of West Australia where lakes are saltbogs without surface water springs seldom run and native wells are merely tiny holes in the rock yielding from 0 to 200 gallons‚ù Carnegie also describes nammaholes and soaks as sources of water Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir Nammaholes have been variously described to Carnegie they are depressions on the surface of rocks often with a rounded bottom where stones are often found suggesting that the stones have something to do with the formation of the holes Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the loss in our speech of English country words the glens and streams alive anyway in the journals of explorers coppices and brooks woods becks and rivulets Perhaps these words did not really fit We might have done better with Arabicspeaking settlers Wadi for instance would describe an inland creek rather well Be that as it may a later Australian visitor to English drizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the parched and thirsty but waterobsessed vocabulary developed in the drier areas of our sunburnt land Favorite Grammatical Game Puzzling Pronouns Here is a game just made to while away the hours on a commuter train with your

language of exile without a land without frontiers not supported by any government a language which possesses no words for weapons ammunition military exercises war tactics There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life every crumb of success each encounter of love In a figurative way Yiddish is the wise and humble language of us all the idiom of a frightened and hopeful humanity The word Yiddish derives from the German judisch Jewish The principal parent of Yiddish is High German the form of German encountered by Jewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh century Yiddish is written in the characters of the Hebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys borrowing words from Russian Polish English and all the other languages and countries along the routes that Jews have traveled during the past thousand years Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped ‚úI speak ten languages‚all of them Yiddish‚ù Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out

schmendrik schnook schmegegge schlep schlub schmuck putz klutz kvetch and nudnik Yiddish easily coins new names for new personalities a nudnik is a pest a phudnik is a nudnik with a PhD The rich nuances that suffuse this roll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a schlemiel clumsy jerk and a schlimazel habitual loser the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot soup‚all over the schlimazel And the nebbish is the one who has to clean it up The Yiddish language through its color its targetaccurate expressions its raw idioms and its sayings exudes a refreshing magic and laughter mixed with sober thought that has been handed down from generation to generation and from nation to nation Yiddish never apologizes for what it is‚the earthy wise soul of an expressive people learning that life is but a mingled yarn good and ill together Which reminds us of the zaftig buxom wellrounded blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a charity ball ‚úIt happens to be the third most famous diamond in the whole world‚ù she boasted ‚úThe first is the Hope diamond then comes the Kohinoor and then comes this one which is called the Lipschitz‚ù ‚úWhat a stone How lucky you are‚ù

book recently published in Britain that is typical of the harsher brand of such works The work in question offers nothing regarding language so its review here is ancillary to the main function of VERBATIM The feminist movement is very much alive in Britain and the ‚úGreenham Common Women‚ù are probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the Cruise missiles installed at an American base near that village In Britain as elsewhere most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women usually feminists Men are seldom assigned to review them possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if not biased against them or because the editor is a woman Because writing an unfavorable review of a bad feminist book would be tantamount to treachery such books are often unjustifiably praised as was the case with this work by Rosalind Miles which was well received on its publication in June According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book Rosalind Miles is head of the Centre for Womens Studies at Coventry Polytechnic a lecturer broadcaster journalist and author of several other books including a ‚úhighly acclaimed‚ù biography of Ben Jonson One might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship but the text does not bear out the promise For the most part the book consists of a rewriting of history from the dawn of time with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes the ‚úfact‚ù that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization as the development of agriculture for instance often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men and the ‚úfact‚ù that women have long been subjected to domination by men Miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenon‚only a couple of thousand years old‚for she points to the clear superiority of women in primitive religions and matriarchies right on through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers At one point she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting in order to keep track of menstruation and probably by the same token astronomy She quotes and presumably accepts another source which holds that ‚úwoman first awakened in humankind the capacity to recognize abstracts‚ù If you believe that balderdash youll believe anything In the good old days we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves Recent speculation has it that they were not slaves but‚what would one call them ‚ ordinary laborers Here comes Miles authoritatively quoting Diodorus the Greek historian who recorded 6030BC that ‚úinnocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves whose forced labour built the pyramids bound in fetters they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day They have not a rag to cover their nakedness and neither the weakness of age nor womens infirmities are any plea to excuse them but they are driven by blows until they drop dead‚ù p49 As the pyramids were already about 2500 years old when Diodorus wrote his World History one is given to wonder what his authority might have been for such a vivid description It is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it Miless book is riddled with many similar distortions convenient omissions and generalizations Women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity From the poet Sappho who in the sixth century BC was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively and explore the range of female experience to the Chinese polymath Pan Chao Ban Zhao who flourished around AD 100 as historian poet astronomer mathematician and educationalist the range is startling In every field women too numerous to list were involved in developing knowledge and contributing to the welfare of their societies as they did so the Roman Fabiola established a hospital where she worked both as nurse and doctor becoming the first known woman surgeon before she died in AD 399 p52 Earlier on page 49 we learnt about Agnodice ‚úwho lived to become the worlds first known woman gynaecologist‚ù in the fourth century BC Clearly this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced chiefly it seems as JudeoChristianIslamicConfucianBuddhist cultures flourished It was not too bad early on when according to Miles the seven Maccabean martyrs who ‚úsaved Judaism‚ù did so only at the instigation of their mother Miles continues In early Christianity likewise women found not merely a role but an instrument of resistance to male domination in choosing to be a bride of Christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male fry Thousands of young women helped to build the church of God with their body blood and bones when frenzied fathers husbands or fianc√s preferred to see them die by fire sword or the fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout sic the duty and destiny of womanhood p63 But the situation soon deteriorated Even St Paul later the unregenerate prophet of female inferiority was forced to acknowledge the help he received from Lydia the seller of purple dyes in Philippi ibid This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of fourletter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring and so forth to women Citing a Judaic lawbook of the 16th century which identified a woman for the days preceding during and following her period as niddah impure Miles has the lack of taste to write the following As a final stroke in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held in store for the Jews the niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge of her separate and despised status p83 Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding Miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with the eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell Campbell known for his extensive analyses of the worlds mythologies religions and cultures noted the marked bias against women emerging from Judaic concepts later reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine Most of the religions of the world connected woman with mother earth fertility and all the other progenetic and nurturing associations and this was borne out in the cultures of the people According to Campbell the only godlike female figure in the Bible is the Virgin Mary and she appears identified as virgin only in the Gospel according to Luke As Luke was a Greek Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryover from the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon Although this might help explain the JudeoChristianMuslim tendencies to subjugate women treating them essentially as chattel it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures notably that of Japan It is not entirely clear whether Campbell was commenting on Hinduism Buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful With all respect that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities or divinity when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners and progeny Other debatable aspects are the questions of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of the theology or the ritual whether the scripture of any religion should be understood allegorically or literally and so forth If there is something wrong it behooves us to get at the roots of the problem not to flail about wildly for only after the source of a disease has been identified can one properly investigate its cure ‚úHistory according to Rosalind Miles‚ù blasts away at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating them will effect a cure of the disease In this jeremiad males are viewed as the ‚úenemy‚ù and are so characterized throughout the book

assume that we now know all we are ever likely to know about the past someone digs another hole and unearths literally or figuratively some ancient artifact one day it is a fragile scroll found in a cave near the Dead Sea that turns out to be preBiblical the next day it is an entire terracotta army of Chinese soldiers the next it is a skull excavated from the Olduvai Gorge that compels anthropologists once again to revise their guesses about the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs hominids Most of the relies from the past are gone forever destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers reduced to rubble by erosion by conquerors by prehistoric and modern urban developers by fire and flood and just by time Many we may hope have not yet been found The interest in mans forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication a few years ago of Roots on a far larger scale we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man Strange to say however that interest does not seem to be more than a few hundred years old if the ancient Greeks and Romans the Indians the Chinese and other peoples were curious about their own prehistory I have not heard of it Perhaps the fascination with mans past grew out of the obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism certainly modern archaeology seems to have followed close behind for the excavation of the supposed site of Troy took place only about 100 years ago Perhaps it is just as well for only by the means available to modern science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts that we find and through radiocarbon dating determine their approximate age Archaeology is a popular pursuit and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums Not so paleolinguistics or the reconstruction of ancient languages Even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse Classical Latin and Greek Hebrew and a few other languages are better documented than others but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions there barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning Perhaps one day we shall find an Etruscan library buried deep in the Italian countryside but for the present we have to make do with what we have which is precious little About languages that had no writing system we know nothing at all But some very clever comparative linguists beginning in Germany in the 19th century theorized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues In some instances ancient languages have been decoded some from multilingual inscriptions The work of Jean Francois Champollion 17901832 in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta Stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient Egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we have today about their civilization which lasted for about 2600 years Another significant breakthrough was that of Michael Ventris 19221956 who deciphered the Linear B script found on Crete and identified it as an early form of Greek From the standpoint of language Ventriss work was more important particularly because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of the early states of IndoEuropean languages Many years ago a linguistic scholar counted all of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence The total was approximately 2800 but that is probably only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed some some have sprung up since his time modern Hebrew for instance and some have vanished The exact count is unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language Then too one must examine the techniques used to group the many languages of the world Linguists examining Classical Greek Latin German English Slavic Swedish Norwegian Danish Dutch Lithuanian Iranian Hindi and the other languages of India and Europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words Some like French Spanish Italian and Portuguese had more in common with one another than they did with say German English Swedish Danish and Dutch which in turn bore only a remote resemblance to Russian and Polish on the one hand and the two extant varieties of say Gaelic on the other One rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages the number of different main branches called families and subfamilies came to about ten Ingeniously certain differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that inexplicably took place in one language group but not in another Although certain other languages were geographically nearby it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them hence Basque for example is not classified as being in the same family with other European languages nor are Hungarian and Finnish both of which belong to their own group At the conclusion of this vast exercise done without the aid of computers there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken in earlier times from Britain as far east as Chinese Turkestan and from India as far north as Lappland Charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionaries‚inside the front cover of The Random House Unabridged for example Because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among languages it is best to avoid using an older chart for the same reason it would be wise not to stake too much on the accuracy of even a current chart The languages discussed here are what are usually called the IndoEuropean family similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages SinoTibetan Japanese Bantu MalayoPolynesian and so on Each is a distinct phylum although there may be wordborrowing among them lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar It is important too to note that writing systems are irrelevant for instance Polish is written today using the Roman alphabet but Russian a related Slavic language uses the Cyrillic Yiddish a Germanic language is written in Hebrew characters Latin Greek and Sanskrit which resemble one another rather closely in some respects all use different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages were written in cuneiform quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics It would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organize languages they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials But only rarely did they collaborate and with few exceptions their work was not correlated in a systematic way Schliemann who discovered the site of Troy used the evidence in Homers Iliad to determine his digging site where any ruins had long since disappeared from view In many other places the ancient sites lay buried‚and still do‚beneath modern cities modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below today before a new building is erected in London an archaeological team examines the cleared site for its archaeological significance But there as everywhere else nothing can interfere with progress and regardless of the finds and their importance the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer Notwithstanding even the brief glimpses afforded by such investigations can provide some insight into civilizations that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands of years earlier Based on the sparse evidence available linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested In other words based on what they knew about a group of languages which were documented they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from In most cases they dealt with words and functional elements creating what are called reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called variously ProtoLatin ProtoGreek ProtoGermanic ProtoIndoIranian and so forth the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called ProtoIndoEuropean That is not entirely true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was literally a single language from which all IndoEuropean languages descended Nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of protodialects which can be referred to as ProtoIndoEuropean It seems only natural that once an original language or Ursprache was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or Urheimat That is what Renfrew has tried to do Essentially he proposes that the parent of all IndoEuropean languages was itself born in central Anatolia whence it spread eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable modern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic Hellenic Italic IndoIranian Anatolian Armenian Celtic Tocharian Albanian and BaltoSlavic I have no quarrel with Renfrews theory‚notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region and the Volga steppes It is difficult for the nonspecialist reader like me to assess the validity of his arguments which are based on his contention that the language and its congeners were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism Using the evidence available Renfrew contends that the original IndoEuropean language closely related to Hittite separated after 6500 BC with the IE languages of western Europe developing from western Anatolia and those of Iran India and Pakistan from the eastern division The choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrews depends on whether one accepts a ‚úwave‚ù theory first promulgated more than a hundred years ago by Johnanes Schmidt a German linguist or one of indigenous development Pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture from Turkmenia or a late development of the Indus civilization Renfrew accepts the wave theory and in the last two thirds of Archaeology Language he sets forth his arguments in its favor Unfortunately the presentation of his linguistic argument where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology where he is on more familiar territory is disorganized and repetitious It is difficult to place all the blame on Renfrew for his editor should have noticed the lack of coherence The result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely convincing Nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy to find and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of IndoEuropean Archaelogy Language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory

forth everything with clarity and the program is simple to install requiring only a few minutes Only one thing made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system in the descriptive text that appears on the screen the word labeled is spelt ‚úlabelled‚ù‚decidedly unAmerican However I went ahead and since I was typing the text you are reading returned to the beginning of the paragraph to see how some of these words would fare I looked up the word preceding and was after a brief moment asked to type in the word which I did The screen bloomed forth with the following Query preceding 1 adj being before especially in time or arrangement There were also some other parts of speech one definition for the preposition and three for the verb participial senses I called up the synonyms for the adj and the following appeared Synonyms antecedent anterior foregoing former past precedent previous prior The way the program works is this one uses the cursor to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are desired It is similar in principle to finding a synonym in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms to find them I am not sure why but I expected the program to ‚únetwork‚ù in the same way However when I highlighted antecedent what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing and preceding had reappeared If all this is too complicated to follow let me summarize you look up word X and get synonyms A B C D E F and G You look up the synonyms for word A and you get synonyms X B C D E F and G Even the definition provided for the sublistings is identical in wording to that of the word originally sought This is very economical of space and involves a clever computer ploy but it does not provide a particularly useful synonym dictionary for as we all know synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics in language ‚úThings equal to the same thing are not necessarily equal to each other‚ù Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the items in the list but we know that only very rarely are two synonyms biunique which is another way of saying that if A B B does not necessarily always equal A an ineluctable fact of language If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary is likely to be of use then this package may be of service It works with a hard disk or with a set of floppies and can be used with 29 popular wordprocessing programs That was the number listed when I received my copy it might have increased It also has a few neat features like suggesting a few alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is spelt ‚úpreceeding‚ù as many people do It has a useful ‚úHelp‚ù feature that can be called upon at any stage Also if you enter jump you get the synonyms for that but if you enter jumped you get the same synonyms but inflected‚including the variants leapt leaped for leap All in all for a relatively primitive system it is not too bad but you would have to be in love with your computer to use it in preference to a far more complete books of synonyms available especially The Synonym Finder Rodale in the US and Canada Longman elsewhere which offers more than 800000 synonyms more than three times the number listed in any other synonym book The blurb on this bookdisk package reads ‚úSupplies you with 470000 true synonyms for 40000 entries‚ù My guess is that such a quantity might be reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations in reality though there are

tells me the following origin of shot as in shotglass absent from ‚úGunning for the English Language‚ù Although we associate trench warfare with World War I trenches were characteristic also of the Civil War A scaffold was built so that a rifleman‚ who fired a singleshot muzzleloading shoulder weapon‚could step up and shoot over the top of the trench The soldier in charge would command after each firing that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire That war like others produced disgruntled veterans and those more adventurous or more restless after military service They moved westward to start a new life The population increased markedly with corresponding demands for goods and services

scrap of paper On it was written this sentence ‚úPlease make me go to the bathroom‚ù You Could Look It Up As everyone in the world must know by now William Safire writes a column in The New York Times Magazine called ‚úOn Language‚ù Considering the circulation of The New York Times on Sundays his column is probably the most widely read commentary on contemporary English in the world that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer he must do his utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjects likely to be of interest to his readers and he must write well Those familiar with Safires editorial style reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of The N Y Times may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off I cannot put my finger on why but ‚úOn Language‚ù always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute In part that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents who keep him informed on language that is not within earshot as the ‚úLexicographic Irregulars‚ù an amusing reference the first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy More often than it might prove of interest to me personally Safire deals with insiders language in Washington where he is based or with trivialities uttered by some politico As Andrew Norman wrote in a letter published in this book on page 113 ‚úYou flit freely back and forth between prescriptivism and descriptivism‚ù But are not many of us guilty of that We are descriptive of the usages we accept and prescriptive‚perhaps proscriptive would be more descriptive‚of those we do not like At least Safire expresses an opinion whether the reader agrees with him is another matter as are the questions of his accuracy which arise fairly often and that of the suitability of his style which as far as I know has not been broached before It ill behooves me excoriated recently as enamored of the ‚úcheap larf‚ù to criticize Safires arch puns which

words ibid Writing containing such labored figures makes for hard reading I am interested in what Safire has to say about language but find myself stymied I get the feeling that he has deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which I must pick my way to the end Notwithstanding the valuable role he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject I find it hard slogging or as he would probably write ‚úsloguing‚ù You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection of Safires columns and like the previous collections contains a selection of letters from readers It is those that are so sorely missed in his column True there is an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a correspondent and the Letters section of the Magazine prints a comment from time to time but an important feature of the books is their inclusion of far more writerreader interaction than one might suspect from reading the column alone For one thing the letterwriters call attention to errors or misinterpretations and are largely critical Safire cannot be accused of being copyproud except evidently of awful puns as in ‚ú Ms is deliberately msterious but at least it is not deliberately msleading ‚ù and other mscegenations There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the most influential writers on contemporary English and it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all who are interested in the subject regardless of their alignment with his opinions For one thing he documents many neologisms an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers From the sometimes cavalier manner in which he treats his subject one wonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility he has toward his readers The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from which this review was prepared unfortunately there was no proof of an index but the publisher has assured me that there will be one in the published book a rather essential ingredient of a work with this title Laurence Urdang Websters New World Guide to Current American Usage Here is a commonsense style book

up but I am hard put to agree that they are quite as frivolous and lightheaded as this book would have us believe Fun is fun but those who might rely on such a book are quite serious about the information they are seeking and it is unfair to play fast and loose with their sincerity A sense of humor about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it but security is the one characteristic often lacking among those who would use Current American Usage There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her work But of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms And of what use are the interminable examples for instance of the misuse of like for as which draw out the entry to three pages More than four pages are devoted to clich√s under the guise of ‚úLo and behold its mans best

accurate though longwinded information about what it covers ‚úinteresting and useful facts about American English‚ù Its only real faults are its title which belies the content the cutesy headings and the lack of a truly detailed index selfindexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail As a reference work on usage it is far from complete The Simon and Schuster Publicity Department could

From The Times 16 May 1988 Loose Cannons Red Herrings Readers should be familiar with Robert Claibornes earlier books especially Our Marvelous Native Tongue The Life and Times of the English Language One might say that subtitling the present book ‚úA Book of Lost Metaphors‚ù is an example of a loose canon sic ‚ unless metaphor is taken in its broadest sense‚but one is unlikely to find red herrings here the etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are given many not readily findable in standard works of reference The rationale behind referring to them as ‚úlost‚ù arises from the authors observation of an unfortunate state of affairs because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic structural elements of our culture‚Greek and Roman mythology the Bible literature and ordinary historical fact‚people today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac Achilles sic heel or tendon meet ones Waterloo sow dragons teeth and handwriting on the wall to name a few There are many of course but unaccountably they are not the focus of this book Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow ones wild oats about which he tells us little or nothing the modern Latinate designation Avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it so why bring up the information that fatua is Latin for foolish it was also Latin for wild which might be more to the point In any event it is hard to discern from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting just what is the origin of sow ones wild oats In many entries Claiborne labors the obvious offering little or nothing we do not already know could easily imagine or for which the author offers no explanation Among examples of the first are spit and polish on the spot on the square stick ones neck out etc Examples of the last include spill the beans square the circle stalemate etc Between these is an occasional flash of useful wisdom much of it pretty well covered by other books of this type which seem to be proliferating What is missing for example at square the circle is the information that because the area of a circle is mathematically calculated using pi which is irrational there is no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a given circle But that does not mean that such a square cannot exist As for stalemate which is related to checkmate would it not have been important to indicate that the mate part has nothing to do with English having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from Persian and has nothing to do with check either Often an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology and merely explains the meaning Does any reader need an entry like this one straddle When you straddle a horse youve got one leg on either side of the animal When a politican straddles an issue hes in much the same position Some speculative suggestions as

which as everyone ought to know does not include Wales or Scotland The present book is extracted from the two major works that resulted from the Survey The Linguistic Atlas of England 1978 and A Word Geography of England 1974 both under the direction of Harold Orton aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter effort People generally seem to find dialect study interesting One letter writer to The Times 21 June 1988 reported Our close neighbour in Bere Regis who was born in the village and who speaks with a delicious Dorset burr always uses ‚úI‚ù instead of ‚úme‚ù ‚úWell it makes company for I and company for she‚ù Another of his happy expressions is innerwards meaning since as in‚úI chucked him out the door and hes not been back innerwards‚ù Another reported same date Lets get it right The Bristol for ‚úme‚ù is not ‚úI‚ù but ‚úoi‚ù When I was teaching there the explanation invariably given by boys brought to me for scrapping in the playground was ‚úEe it oi so oi it ee‚ù The 100 maps selected for representation from the Survey yield information on several hundred words some of which are clear variants others quite different lexical entities For instance Map 34 shows the areas marked off by boundary lines where the variants chimley chimbley chimmock chimdey chimbey and chimney occur Map 33 shows the distribution of child most of southern England and of bairn north of a slightly wavy line between Boston on the Wash to the east and Lancaster on the west coast The authors have provided a brief introduction which is easy to follow a list of suggested readings and the names and addresses of the several institutions and societies in Britain where readers may indulge a more intensive interest in dialect study The maps are clear each occupying a full page and the word information is well set forth on them Where necessary brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any information that might seem to be out of the ordinary I have only one nit to pick with the authors In their description of isoglosses they write These are drawn to run midway between localities which were shown by the Survey of English Dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of the map Although it is true that isoglosses in effect set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or where speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity Hence the term isogloss from iso same gloss word to describe the line on a map where the terms are of equal distribution Isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps what isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans etc The authors are not alone in getting this wrong it is incorrect in some dictionaries In those countries where dialect study is undertaken dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals news services radio and television the establishment of ‚úprestige‚ù dialects and through the media their promulgation and the huge population shifts that have taken place particularly in the US since WWII Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England but seem now to be speeding up There are many other lesser factors at work but taken together all tend toward standardization especially as the older speakers die off In some respects it may not be long before certain aspects of dialect geography will be largely historical The importance of dialect is emphasized regularly in the press where we read about people being killed as in parts of India because they use the wrong shibboleths This book is a good introduction to the subject in England those familiar with dialectology in America and those interested in the study in England or indeed generally would be well advised to add Word Maps to their libraries Laurence Urdang American Literary Almanac This is an interesting useful reference book containing information about the betterknown writers of America It is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length each dealing with a different aspect of the authors and their works among them Writers Related to Writers Schooldays which colleges and universities spawned which writers American Literary Pseudonyms American Literary Title Sources Literary Cons Hoaxes Frauds and Plagiarism in American Literature The Profession of Authorship AuthorsPublishers EditorsAgents Thrown to the Wolves Reviews and Reviewers These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography and a detailed Index As can be seen from the chapter headings some of the material is trivial but nonetheless interesting for that It is not at once apparent why the book is styled an ‚úalmanac‚ù but that is unimportant there is no other book I know of that contains as much diverse information about American writers as this one Its readability and organization make it suitable for browsing‚even for reading straight through‚so in that respect at least it does not resemble books in the ‚úOxford Companion‚ù series It contains many photographs of writers some quite early these enliven the appearance of the book but accomplish little else unless one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked like at the age of 15 as a printers devil or in the appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a railroad track in Cleveland in 1916 It is difficult to make any sensible connection between the lives of authors and their creations A handful might have led colorful existences some are objects of interest because they died early committed suicide were related to other famous people and so forth but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much This book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries public and private large and small general and specialized Laurence Urdang ‚úFaculty
